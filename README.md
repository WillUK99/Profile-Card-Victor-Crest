### About
This the first small challenge I have completed by https://www.frontendmentor.io/, using the inital designs given from the site
I replicated them using HTML and CSS. I gave myself 30 minutes to complete this challenge, the main crux of the challenge for me was 
correctly alligning the .svgs imgs in the background. I also added a transition just to make the profile feel more alive.
